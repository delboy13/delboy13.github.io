"CardMS POC goal was to look at the option of moving
our Token Management System off the Unysis platoform
onto to SAP platform. 
Looking at functional and non-functional requirement, mapping
the architecture"

<p>
This was the biggest project i was lucky enough to join. 
It was an end to end process which involved the collaboration of many different teams and colleagues, 
from Architects to Developers.

The objective was to provide a Proof of Concept for the migation of our Token Managment System from Unisys to SAP.
 It was a complete breakdown of the current process and mapping of the functional and non-functional requirements.

This gave me the opportunity to concentrate on a smaller part of Nationwide, systems and processes. 
It was time seeing the effective use of Jira and Confluence to manage the project and document our findings.

I was able to gain first hand experience of the use of Agile and lifecycle of the project by 
attending daily standups and observing how each iteration contributed towards the evolution of the project.

This was a great experience as I gained alot of exposure to the process of project management and collaboration.

I was able to develop my networking and benefit from the use of Jira and Confluence. 
I was able to understand more about the complexity of the infrastructure and architecture 
and start to learn about the systems and processes such Base24, Visa Suite.

I also saw the interactions with 3rd party systems as well as how we 
structure, collect, process data and protect.

Finally, it gave me more opportunity to work with colleagues on the 
SAP System and ABAP language to build towards being able to contribute in my business area.

										My first project from start to finish â€“ observing how a task is started and managed regarding a proof of concept.
										The cardms POC has given me invaluable insight into the process of a task from start to finish. Introducing me to the practical uses of working in a team in an agile way seeing how sprints are formed and run to stand ups, creating Jira tickets and working from those tickets, the use of confluence to provide information as the task progresses, the systems and processes in place for key functionality of businesses requirements, the different people involved in working together and a sense of the complexity of all of this working together. 
										I have been able to learn about the workings of how Nationwide manage everything to do with the management and use of cards from Opening accounts, plastic card production, pin mailing, PAN encryption and storage which also introduced me to the many aspects of the architecture involved including those of 3rd parties such as indemia, G&D, nucleas, BOSS, Transform,Unisys, SAP, BASe24, CIS, Visa, Discovery, CAW, Transactis, Visa Suite, TMUI, MSTI & information station.
