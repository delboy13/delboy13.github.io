	This involved looking at the potential implantation, put forward from Matt Daber, to test an opensource API which would scrape skills out of job descriptions/ CVs. This involved working with fellow TDP’ers (Serena Dhins,  Yash Sandu & Nish Gnanalingam). It involved testing the EMSI API using Postman and also, writing python script to confirm that skills can be extracted from a word document, where a demo was also carried out.
	Python script can be seen here: https://github.com/yashsandu-NBS/EMSI-Skills-Extractor.
	<br>“This was a completely new subject and concept to look at as well as getting involved for me. 
	I mainly contributed by helping organise the meetings and practicing the idea of being a scrum master. It took me out of my comfort zone and lead me to contacting Ellie Townsend to help me further understand API’s.
	Some of the challenges I faced were;<br>
	•	Firstly, understanding what an API was and how this would be used.”<br>
	•	Using POSTMAN
